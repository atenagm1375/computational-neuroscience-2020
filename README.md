# computational-neuroscience-2020

This includes the project series for Computational Neuroscience 
Master Course 2020 at University of Tehran. 

It includes neuron models(LIF, ELIF, AdaptiveELIF), spiking
neural network framework including neural populations and
synaptic connections, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
in SNNs(STDP and rSTDP), and basic image processing using DoG
and Gabor filters.
